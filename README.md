  Tron Monitor
</h1>
Tron Monitor is a monitoring script built in Powershell to check and monitor that your SR Node is producing blocks. The script will send an email alert to you if your node hasn't produced blocks for over 2 minutes. This will be most useful for Tron Super Representatives & Tron Super Representative Candidates, although anyone running a Tron Node can use it to prepare themselves for being voted into top 27 as an SR.

# How to use
You are not obligated to run the tron-monitor script on the same system that runs your witness node.
Firstly, you will need to install powershell on the machine which you choose to monitor your **java-tron** witness node from.

   ## Installing Powershell on Ubuntu 16.04
      # Import the public repository GPG keys
        curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo apt-key add -

      # Register the Microsoft Ubuntu repository
        curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/16.04/prod.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft.list

      # Update apt-get
        sudo apt-get update

      # Install PowerShell
        sudo apt-get install -y powershell

      # Start PowerShell
        powershell
